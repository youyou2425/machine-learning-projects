# Cervical Cancer Prediction using XGBoost

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict **cervical cancer biopsy results** (0 = no cancer, 1 = cancer) based on patient data, including **age, smoking history, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and screening test results**. The goal is to develop a model that helps in early detection, reducing unnecessary procedures while minimizing missed diagnoses.

## Key Highlights
- **Best Model:** XGBoost with optimized precision and recall
- **Class Imbalance:** Used combination of SMOTE_NC and scale_pos_weight in XGBoost to address class imbalance
- **Feature Importance:** Identified key risk factors using SHAP values
- **Threshold Tuning:** Improved model performance by selecting the best threshold (0.70)
- **Performance Metrics:** Achieved a balance between precision (0.65) and recall (1.0) on test data

## Results
| Metric  | Training | Testing  |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Precision | 0.89 | 0.65 |
| Recall | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| F1-score | 0.94 | 0.79 |

- **SMOTE_NC and scale_pos_weight** improved precision and recall.
- **SHAP analysis helped identify key features** contributing to cancer predictions.
- **Threshold tuning improved precision while maintaining recall.**

## Next Steps
- Experiment with **ensemble models**
- Explore **deep learning approaches** (e.g., Neural Networks)
- Integrate the model into a **web application** for clinicians
